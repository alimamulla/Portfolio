## How to customize diagrams, connectors and its shortcuts

### Duplicate the diagram

To duplicate the entire diagram, you must first select it by `Ctrl+A` (`Cmd+A` on a Mac), or `Edit > Select All`. Alternatively, you can also drag a frame with your mouse to select all shapes.

To duplicate only certain areas of a diagram, just push and hold the `Shift` key and select them with your mouse. Make sure that all objects and connectors you want to duplicate are selected.

Duplicate the diagram or the selected shapes by right-clicking and select **Duplicate**, or use the shortcut `Ctrl+D` (`Cmd+D` on a Mac). Or you can use the menu bar `Edit > Duplicate`.

</div> 

### Replace shapes

To convert a shape, drag the desired shape from **General shape library** over the already existing one until you see the blueblack conversion icon. You can do this to more than one shape at a time. In this case, select all blue rectangle shapes you’d like to replace and drag the new shape over one of the selected rectangles.

### Rotate shapes

There are a couple of ways to rotate shapes:

- Use the blueblack rotate icon. This is displayed when you select a shape.  
- Change the angle of the shape or rotate it 90° in the **Arrange** tab in the **Format Panel** on the right.

</div> 


## Entering text

Add any shape to your diagram. After you insert the shape, you can directly start typing to add text to it. Later, you can click or double-click on a shape and start typing to enter the text inside the shape.

To change the position or format of the text inside the shape, use the **Text** tab of the **Format Panel** on the right.

By adjusting the spacing at the bottom of the Text tab, you can set the location of the text.

You can also place text freely on the drawing area. Double click on an empty area of your diagram and choose the **Text** option from the shape picker.

Text size, font and color can be altered in the **Text** tab of the **Format Panel**. Double-click on the text to get enhanced text options in the Format panel.

## Add and connect new shapes

Click on a blue arrow of your selected or unselected (when you hover over the shape with your mouse) rectangular shape, so the **Draw.io shape picker** opens.

Choose the shape in the upper left corner to duplicate the original shape 1:1 (or use one of the most used shapes from the general shape library). The shape and its content are duplicated and connected with a connector in the direction of the arrow on which you clicked.
<div align="center">
<img src="images/12.png" alt="icon" width="215"  />
<img src="images/13.png" alt="icon" width="220"  />
</div>



Now add another shape at the bottom of the rectangle. Drag the shape on the bottom blue arrow of the rectangle to add and connect it at the same time.


## Add text to connectors

Double-click on the connector where you like to add the text to and start typing.

Use the **yellow diamond icon** to reposition the text if needed. You can modify the text with the same panels that you used to edit and format your text in shapes.
