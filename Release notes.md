### ✉️ Introducing Voice Message Transcripts  

Now you can read voice messages instead of listening to them. Perfect when you’re in a meeting or a quiet place.  
Voice messages are transcribed into text to help you keep up with conversations no matter what you’re doing.  
Transcripts appear right below the voice message, automatically.
